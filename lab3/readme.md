To run the algothmns,  changes to the input files have to be made.

The matrixA.list and matrixB.list have to be changed to Matrix1.txt and Matrix2.txt respectively so that it becomes compatible with  algorithm1.py and algorthm2.py.  
	E.g outA1.list to Matrix1.txt and outB2.list to Matrix2.txt 

MrJobs was used for this lab , to run the algorithms  the following command needs to be typed in the terminal:

python <name of algorithm> Matrix1.txt Matrix2.txt  

The results will be displayed on the terminal with the time taken to execute the program
